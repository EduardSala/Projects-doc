This repository contains a collection of academic projects, presentations, and related documentation developed during my university studies in Aerospace Engineering.
Where applicable, each project includes the corresponding code scripts used for analysis, simulations, or data processing.

The objective of this repository is to present my academic work in a structured and accessible way, showcasing both the technical content and the methodologies applied.
